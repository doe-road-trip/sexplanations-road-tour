Five’ish hours later at the hospital we were discharged without any good answers but he seems to be on the mend. We drove south where I satiated a guilty pleasure (Chick-fil-a) and grocery shopped for some healthier eats. I bought a basil plant that we call Marvelous Mrs. Basil. We finished watching The Wiz and then winded down to the somewhat terrifying sounds of a car repossession followed later by car drifting and police intervention. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1263\" data-orig-width=\"1096\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/44568016ee51e7341a4848c312edd1b9/tumblr_inline_plgk50p49j1s144lm_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1263\" data-orig-width=\"1096\"/></figure><p><b>Saturday January 12, 2019</b></p><p>Happy that we survived the night in a parking lot, Nels and I drove to a nearby RV village where we were able to empty our gray and black water tanks for only $10. We also cleaned out our fresh water tanks and did dishes in house for the first time! An hour later we were San Francisco at Aunt Linda’s. She made us brunch and talked to us about sex and aging, hormones, incontinence, impotence, and dating. I’m excited to turn the conversation into an episode of Sexplanations.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"968\" data-orig-width=\"981\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40fbe7cb01bb8b87129a00fb745fe15e/tumblr_inline_plgk6aAW3l1s144lm_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"968\" data-orig-width=\"981\"/></figure><p>Aunt Linda then drove us to our next engagement &ndash; recording videos and a podcast at Mr. S Leather with Amp from Watts the Safeword. Amp had reached out on Twitter and I was so relieved. I wanted to keep going with the Sexplanations podcast and recording video episodes while on tour but we haven’t had time to sort out equipment or set it up. Amp had a studio in San Francisco with lights and microphones and cameras. He invited me in, made me tea, gave me all the time I needed to switch gears in to pro-mode, and then recorded everything for me to share with you. We did a podcast on sexhacks, an episode of Watts the Safeword on sex education, and an episode of Sexplanations YouTube channel about daddies. We just put my memory cards in his gear and voila, production! It was such a huge moment of feeling wrapped up by a safe person and validated as a creator. Amp didn’t judge me for needing his help. He just loved on me and needed that.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"618\" data-orig-width=\"887\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e77b6cfc77937203f0bea107c54f23c/tumblr_inline_plgk6yxsUt1s144lm_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"618\" data-orig-width=\"887\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1368\" data-orig-width=\"1105\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e527d98bdf339b154efa91d3775db69/tumblr_inline_plgk7t6XRx1s144lm_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1368\" data-orig-width=\"1105\"/></figure><p>While we were there I also got a thorough tour of Mr. S Leather. I’d been 12ish years ago when I was in San Francisco for my doctorate but a lot had changed. Amp walked us through the showroom &ndash; gear for every fetish and kink you can imagine. Then as a super treat he took us behind the scenes where most of their products were manufactured, right there in the building! We saw the old latex room with patterns for full suits, the remains of a really comprehensive dungeon, and the shipping warehouse. I was astounded by the passion everywhere. There was so much attention to detail and care for the products! The  foot and half long dragon cock dildo was made by someone who wants that experience to be perfect.</p><p>I left feeling all warm and gooey.

Amp had reached out on Twitter and I was so relieved. I wanted to keep going with the Sexplanations podcast and recording video episodes while on tour but we haven&rsquo;t had time to sort out equipment or set it up. Amp had a studio in San Francisco with lights and microphones and cameras. He invited me in, made me tea, gave me all the time I needed to switch gears in to pro-mode, and then recorded everything for me to share with you. We did a podcast on sexhacks, an episode of Watts the Safeword on sex education, and an episode of Sexplanations YouTube channel about daddies. We just put my memory cards in his gear and voila, production! It was such a huge moment of feeling wrapped up by a safe person and validated as a creator. Amp didn&rsquo;t judge me for needing his help.

I&rsquo;d been 12ish years ago when I was in San Francisco for my doctorate but a lot had changed. Amp walked us through the showroom &ndash; gear for every fetish and kink you can imagine. Then as a super treat he took us behind the scenes where most of their products were manufactured, right there in the building! We saw the old latex room with patterns for full suits, the remains of a really comprehensive dungeon, and the shipping warehouse. I was astounded by the passion everywhere. There was so much attention to detail and care for the products! The &nbsp;foot and half long dragon cock dildo was made by someone who wants that experience to be perfect.</p><p>I left feeling all warm and gooey. Nels left with ideas for rafting wetsuits and a new sex education. We wandered down the street to a coffee shop we learned about at PatreCon called Wicked Grounds. They had offered to host a event but I hadn&rsquo;t been able to follow-though. So I asked a table of friendly faces if they had any sexuality questions for the sexologist on tour. &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; One of them actually had their own sex education channel and was very situated in their knowledge of the subject.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e2e924863f3e9acc259b27f34596279/tumblr_inline_plgk8qDiCE1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I walked away from the cafe feeling very comfortable that we hadn&rsquo;t planned more in California.

It didn’t make a lot of sense. I’d been really peaceful minutes earlier but in the safety of our new home I realized that things were actually really unmanageable. I felt guilty about the lack of planning which was making it difficult for people to meetup with us but maintained an indignant unwillingness to retreat back to Missoula and allot time to plan. The brat in my head went something like “I don’t want to put more time into strategizing, I’ve already worked so hard to get ahead on Sexplanations, to fundraise, and go on the road.” I was a whiny human mess. </p><p>Nels listened then asked that I take things off my plate before I cracked.

Nels’ friend was very lively and told us about the decision to remove things from her own metaphorical plate. She also talked about people who’d had things removed for them like a vineyard where all the plants got sick and ended the business, a local grocer losing 15 million in profits to a chain store moving in, fires, wind storms, death. It gave some much needed perspective and gratitude.</p><p>From there we drove south toward a sex shop meetup at Love Revolution in Ashland, Oregon. Fajitas on the way. We arrived a little bit early decided due to strong rain that way stay abroad and clean house. At 4:58 we made our way across the street to the shop. It was gorgeous. There were Betty Dodson drawings on the walls, chandeliers of half naked men, eco-friendly vibrators, sex position party balloons, rainbow cock pockets, and ethically sourced sheepskin mats for soft sexy time. Brenda, the owner, greeted us at the door and her cockapoo ran up just behind her. I felt like I was at home and even more so when a somatic bodyworker we’d stopped by for the meetup introduced himself and gave me a tour of the space.

Everyone was super kind and down to earth &ndash; something I wanted to remember for the journey going forward. I roamed the store one last time to select a souvenir and decided on an ornament I call Tinkerbeau. Brenda packaged him up safely for me and asked to treat me to my new magical man.

What’s the best way to talk to kids with conservative parents? What do I know about Bethel Church? We discussed the Sexplanations podcast and how they’d found Sexplanations in the first place.

We did all that and then some.</p><p>Then it was back home to the RV and a night in for our first movie in the motorhome: The Wiz.

I spent it planning, cleaning and repairing the motor coach, and sorting gear. The hunt for a quality RV parts supply store began and ended at Allied Trailer Supply in Sacramento.  Having great inventory and quality service, I walked away with plenty to do.  The acquired parts all fit, now the roof vents all work and new vent wind deflectors will go on tomorrow.

I wished that all state issued vehicles had that kind of pride.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86b13f718d2957d8c312b5189905c334/tumblr_inline_pl5c2npX6l1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>First stop: Redding, California. Some fans there planned a meetup at a cafe called the Sweet Spot. I thought it was clever. We got build-your-own salads then sat down to talk. How did I get into the field? What&rsquo;s the best way to talk to kids with conservative parents? What do I know about Bethel Church? We discussed the Sexplanations podcast and how they&rsquo;d found Sexplanations in the first place. Then I asked where we should head for some Redding tourism and was told Turtle Bay and the <a href=\"https://www.visitredding.com/sundial-bridge\">Sundial bridge</a>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3caa620092653147b9149aaf4301ef4d/tumblr_inline_pl5c3iNJkt1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The Sundial bridge was outstanding and there were probably six different species of birds diving for fish in the river below. Turtle Bay was a sort of exploration park surrounding the bridge with lots of gardens and sculptures. I don&rsquo;t like to run, neither does Nels, but the two of us took off along the garden paths for a quick workout before getting back in the RV and heading to Davis. Davis was/is our first big layover stop on the trip. We parked at friends&rsquo;, I walked their dog, then we were treated to a home-cooked meal and time with an infant and toddler.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68fddc6f2381626fb2ba65400a9ecb37/tumblr_inline_pl5c3yYHsD1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Tuesday January 8, 2019</b></p><p>I was certain there was milk inside our friends&rsquo; house and I would finally be able to have peanut butter bumpers so my morning was hasty. Then Nels showed me he&rsquo;d gotten me milk at the store some prior day while I was napping. What a guy!</p><p>I ate in the RV and then went inside the house to plan the day with friends. The outlined agenda was as follows: drive the wagon with four adults, three backpacks, one stroller, and two kids in carseats to the train station, take the double decker train to Sacramento, walk to the Crocker Art Museum, appreciate art, then get dinner and catch the 7 o&rsquo;clock train out. We did all that and then some.</p><p>Then it was back home to the RV and a night in for our first movie in the motorhome: The Wiz. I hadn&rsquo;t seen it before but the half I&rsquo;ve seen now has been mind-bending. The scarecrow played by Michael Jackson sings, &ldquo;ease on down the road.&rdquo; Now the Sexplanations Road Tour has a theme song.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b069442f0cf88701edbda37a032f7890/tumblr_inline_pl5c58iAme1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Wednesday January 9, 2019 written by Nels</b></p><p>Another layover day in Davis, CA. I spent it planning, cleaning and repairing the motor coach, and sorting gear. The hunt for a quality RV parts supply store began and ended at Allied Trailer Supply in Sacramento. &nbsp;Having great inventory and quality service, I walked away with plenty to do. &nbsp;The acquired parts all fit, now the roof vents all work and new vent wind deflectors will go on tomorrow. &nbsp;Since we&rsquo;re finally in a climate that doesn&rsquo;t freeze we turned on the fresh water system, flushed, sanitized and checked the water lines and will have mobile hot showers in our future. RV upkeep and repair was mostly successful. Tinkerbeau did fly off his hook and busted but he&rsquo;s in recovery after superglue surgery. Photos soon.</p><p>Lindsey finished all our laundry, took walks, got lost, did dishes, called friends and professionals, infant-whispered a fussy baby to sleep, and cooked us a delicious green curry. She is still hammering away on the keyboard as I put this entry into the ether. More stops to schedule. More talks to give.</p><p><b>Thursday January 10, 2019</b></p><p>The plan was to go to the beach. I opted out though for a day of self-care. Nels and the friends headed out and I climbed back in bed to rest with the dog. I ended up sleeping until 2 pm! The dog and I went for a walk and then I drove the RV downtown to meet Michael who played a key role in helping us find and secure the RV that is now my home. We talked for a couple of hours about his romantic marriage, Davis weather, timeshares, and how I was doing then walked down the street where I had parked the RV so I could give him a tour. Later I went by myself to a gift shop called Newsbeat and now I&rsquo;m snuggled up in blankets getting situated with emails. </p><p>There is a large padded envelope full of lubes I&rsquo;m supposed to try out. They were overnighted here a couple days ago but I haven&rsquo;t been ready to smell like salted caramel or coat my arms in non-scented silicone for science.

It really really matters to me.”  </p><p>Friday January 4, 2019</p><p>Thursday we stayed up late drinking tea with Ben and talking about the future before camping in his driveway like hardcore vanlifers. With all that tea imbibed, the RV plumbing was activated that night. (Since we were coming from frozen Montana we had winterized the plumbing so nothing would break but now that we’re in warmer temperatures and in need of a toilet regularly we have a semi-operational bathroom!)</p><p>Friday morning I ate RV breakfast &ndash; Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt with Bernice’s Bakery granola from Missoula. It occured to me that I would run out of these items and there was a slight head tilt of mystery about five months of life without Missoula. We drove to visit Nels’ friend Jamie who had the day off from work and the two of them went on a hike in the forest while I took a much-needed shower and got some work done. I wasn’t able to fit 80 hours of assignments into three hours but I was grateful that I got to check some things off the list and have time alone. </p><p>When Nels and Jamie came back to the house we went out for Panang Curry. Ben met us and we talked about Blue Planet playing on the restaurant TV. I didn’t know that octopuses/octopodes could be magenta! </p><p>After food we all went separate directions. Jamie and Nels went to meet up with another friend and put a puzzle together.

The Sex Geek community was gathering for a short-notice potluck so I could spend time with kindred spirits. The house was beautiful and warm. Each person was so cool and the food was wonderful! It was like reconnecting with best friends even though these were people I knew loosely. We took a tour of the house, sat down picnic table style for dinner, then talked for hours. I learned that a handful of the sex geeks there had already been on tour, one of whom had taken on our very mission of providing sex ed around the country via RV. I learned about the Fisting Coven (of women who learn and practice fisting with supervision) and I discussed the infrequency of sexologists with children while smiling at a new baby nearby. I’m curious. Some of the guests did a nude photo shoot featuring an gorgeous apple flower dessert and others compared notes on how they were raised. Everyone had a pretty unique upbringing except two of us who had grown up the same age in the same 6,000 person town in northeast Ohio, competing backstroke on swim teams, and walking past the Hudson green clocktower for milkshakes. Two 37 year old women who became well-known sex educators.</p><p>I eventually brought up my fear of speaking at Oxford’s TEDx in February with one of the sex geeks who is a successful and talented public speaker.  He listened lovingly to my nerves and and boosted my confidence then retrieved a stack of colored notecards for me to write down and practice my speech over the next month. I knew what I was experiencing was a birth. Between my friends, the SPEEC meetup, and nurturing dinner party of colleagues I was being born into trust that this would all be transformative and meaningful. </p><p>Saturday January 5, 2019</p><p>Same morning routine, Nels made coffee and started the ignition. We had a brunch date with friends of his from college at their house. “At their house” is a great preposition when you’re road-tripping I’ve already learned because there’s a grounding feeling of front door, living room, bathroom, family dog etc. that you can’t get eating out at restaurants. AND the food is outstanding, made with love. This food was incredible, the black lab was so affectionate, and their toddler provided the ever so welcome shared activity of observing a tiny human being instead of outputting a lot of energy in small talk. I like Nels friends a lot! </p><p>After we left their place I felt an urgent need to take a nap and have sex, in that order. Nels and I are usually sex-multiple-times-a-day people but we haven’t prioritized it on the road. We got Costco gas, parked in the nearby lot, slept, then had much needed orgasms. I woke up hours later to Nels driving toward Eugene, Oregon where more of his friends had chicken masala for us “at their house.” I stayed in a relaxed state and committed to working later while they all socialized. As I write now they’re playing one of my favorite card games &ndash; Bonanza, and I’m thrilled to be on a nearby couch, wrapped in a blanket, recalling day four. What a wondrous adventure I’m on. </p>","reblog":{"comment":"<p>Thursday January 3, 2019</p><p>Nels is really good about getting up in the morning, hand-grinding and brewing coffee, then driving to our next destination.

The Sex Geek community was gathering for a short-notice potluck so I could spend time with kindred spirits. The house was beautiful and warm. Each person was so cool and the food was wonderful! It was like reconnecting with best friends even though these were people I knew loosely. We took a tour of the house, sat down picnic table style for dinner, then talked for hours. I learned that a handful of the sex geeks there had already been on tour, one of whom had taken on our very mission of providing sex ed around the country via RV. I learned about the Fisting Coven (of women who learn and practice fisting with supervision) and I discussed the infrequency of sexologists with children while smiling at a new baby nearby. I’m curious. Some of the guests did a nude photo shoot featuring an gorgeous apple flower dessert and others compared notes on how they were raised. Everyone had a pretty unique upbringing except two of us who had grown up the same age in the same 6,000 person town in northeast Ohio, competing backstroke on swim teams, and walking past the Hudson green clocktower for milkshakes.

We had a brunch date with friends of his from college at their house. “At their house” is a great preposition when you’re road-tripping I’ve already learned because there’s a grounding feeling of front door, living room, bathroom, family dog etc. that you can’t get eating out at restaurants. AND the food is outstanding, made with love. This food was incredible, the black lab was so affectionate, and their toddler provided the ever so welcome shared activity of observing a tiny human being instead of outputting a lot of energy in small talk. I like Nels friends a lot! </p><p>After we left their place I felt an urgent need to take a nap and have sex, in that order. Nels and I are usually sex-multiple-times-a-day people but we haven’t prioritized it on the road. We got Costco gas, parked in the nearby lot, slept, then had much needed orgasms. I woke up hours later to Nels driving toward Eugene, Oregon where more of his friends had chicken masala for us “at their house.” I stayed in a relaxed state and committed to working later while they all socialized. As I write now they’re playing one of my favorite card games – Bonanza, and I’m thrilled to be on a nearby couch, wrapped in a blanket, recalling day four.
