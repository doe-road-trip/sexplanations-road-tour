It didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. I&rsquo;d been really peaceful minutes earlier but in the safety of our new home I realized that things were actually really unmanageable. I felt guilty about the lack of planning which was making it difficult for people to meetup with us but maintained an indignant unwillingness to retreat back to Missoula and allot time to plan. The brat in my head went something like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put more time into strategizing, I&rsquo;ve already worked so hard to get ahead on Sexplanations, to fundraise, and go on the road.&rdquo; I was a whiny human mess. </p><p>Nels listened then asked that I take things off my plate before I cracked. I evaluated each item but wasn&rsquo;t able to see a way to let any of them go. So I did the next best thing and got out this <a href=\"https://www.fontanasports.com/ptfit-finnhook-multi-roller-folding-massage-tool-31629\">wooden massage tool</a> that Alex Reich of MinuteEarth recommended. I rolled out the stress in my back and went to sleep trusting that more would be revealed. Plus, someone from Twitter asked us to meet at Love Revolution in Ashland the next day and that was something to look forward to.</p><p><b>Sunday January 6, 2019</b></p><p>I woke up great. I suspect the hormone monster was off-duty.</p><p>We drove to meet another of Nels&rsquo; friends for breakfast, a very hip peach farmer. On the way a rafter of turkeys was gobbling down the street and that cheered me up more.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e5840310f2781eb89533a9360ab598a/tumblr_inline_pl5bzfnDUd1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Breakfast for me was baked apples and french toast. Nels&rsquo; friend was very lively and told us about the decision to remove things from her own metaphorical plate. She also talked about people who&rsquo;d had things removed for them like a vineyard where all the plants got sick and ended the business, a local grocer losing 15 million in profits to a chain store moving in, fires, wind storms, death. It gave some much needed perspective and gratitude.</p><p>From there we drove south toward a sex shop meetup at Love Revolution in Ashland, Oregon. Fajitas on the way. We arrived a little bit early decided due to strong rain that way stay abroad and clean house. At 4:58 we made our way across the street to the shop. It was gorgeous. There were Betty Dodson drawings on the walls, chandeliers of half naked men, eco-friendly vibrators, sex position party balloons, rainbow cock pockets, and ethically sourced sheepskin mats for soft sexy time. Brenda, the owner, greeted us at the door and her cockapoo ran up just behind her. I felt like I was at home and even more so when a somatic bodyworker we&rsquo;d stopped by for the meetup introduced himself and gave me a tour of the space. My people!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/430fc97249565ae88d77362ced508806/tumblr_inline_pl5c0xuXIa1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A few others stopped into Love Revolution while I was and I offered sex education, but alas, they were happy just saying hi. I did talk with them about Sexplanations, the road tour, and toy vaginas though and I learned about microwaved bagels as a fifi option. Everyone was super kind and down to earth &ndash; something I wanted to remember for the journey going forward. I roamed the store one last time to select a souvenir and decided on an ornament I call Tinkerbeau. Brenda packaged him up safely for me and asked to treat me to my new magical man. What a treat indeed!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b780afb6e51b977570cfe807d32b1bf3/tumblr_inline_pl5c1nF7sG1s144lm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>As soon as we got back to the RV I hung Tinkerbeau from the kitchen cabinets so he could fly as we drove. Then Nels and I organized everything in the RV so Tinkerbeau would have a nice home. It took hours and meant making a mess to assess what would go where but we successfully created a giveaway pile, a trash pile, and a recycling pile &ndash; everything else was neatly stashed away.</p><p>Then we decided to drive the mountain pass and get a little closer to our next destination. Up and over we went happy to have all our affairs in order, then Nels parked us at a sweet green meadow at the bottom of the pass to sleep and other things.</p><p><b>Monday January 7, 2019</b></p><p>Time to go to California!

I’m more of a night owl so I’m good at sleeping through all of this &ndash; except today. The wind rattled the RV so strongly that it reminded me of the shuttle launches I learned about at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center. I thought about how this adventure is like a launch into the unknown, an uncomfortable, fast-paced exploration, calculated by a huge team, and executed by few. Was I still willing to stay onboard? </p><figure data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4098a1f54370310f7013df9447a34d07/tumblr_inline_pkwcksOfE91s144lm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\"/></figure><p>I thought about the keychain I had gotten at the Rocket Center for this very trip, an astronaut and how supporters of Sexplanations are called Sexpla(i)nauts. The whole morning felt really sentimental. Especially when we arrived at our first destination: Pasco, Washington’s Country Mercantile which is like an indoor farmers market run by a grocer. I LOVE THIS PLACE! </p><p>A sexpla(i)naut named Dylan coordinated via Twitter to join us. I was thrilled. We ate breakfast and talked about sexuality. One of the special things I took away from our conversation is that fans of the show have a sort of built in sex ed software created from Sexplanations. So, when they have a question, there’s already a sense of the answer because I’ve programmed them. It’s not evil, it’s awesome!</p><p>Nels asked Dylan if he had questions for me and Dylan did, but he also said he knew to a degree how I would answer them and showed throughout breakfast that he was able to critically problem solve things I hadn’t talked about on Sexplanations from things I had talked about. I was a proud Lindsey at this moment. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1458\" data-orig-height=\"1944\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4632497a80b48ee0af072ca64c34de6b/tumblr_inline_pkwc1iEDVw1s144lm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1458\" data-orig-height=\"1944\"/></figure><p>I bought some cherry apple cider, huge apples, some onions, artichoke salsa, and tamales for a sex geek potluck Friday night. We got back on the road and drove again through the wind. The internet was fickle and this slowed my ability to help put out the week’s regular Sexplanations’ video. It went up smoothly anyway and Nels encouraged me to join him on a roadside hike to the top of Multnomah Falls. I thought to myself, “if you want exercise, let’s have sex!” but I knew it wasn’t just physical activity I needed. I needed fresh air and nature. To the hike.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a017b5e05e3ea04d60e880cd60d450/tumblr_inline_pkwcizR7yU1s144lm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\"/></figure><p><b></b>By the time I was ready to be done walking up the trail there was a sign declaring we had done 1 out of 11 switchbacks!? I looked at the sign in disgust and proceeded to go forward. Just like with the Sexplanations Road Tour my belief was that a past me knew what would be best for a future me and even though present me would struggle, it would be worth it. I thought of a lot of metaphors on the hike and topics for Sexplanations’ episodes. I pondered how jumping into the 620 foot falls would be the fastest way down but then I’d be dead. </p><p>I did want Swedish meatballs, lingonberry juice, and retail therapy at Ikea before dinner at 5:30 and a speaking engagement at 7, so I ran down the mountain and got in the driver’s seat. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1ac17295d1f2dfa9afd2197f00370b6/tumblr_inline_pkwce5I5DW1s144lm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/></figure><p>We did Ikea in 45 minutes &ndash; got a cutting board, some floor mats, and cookware. Then it was off to Portland for real this time. Ethiopian food and my dear friend Ben from middle school were waiting for us. One of my greatest pleasures is eating with my hands.</p><p>After dinner, and just down the street was a meetup at the Sex Positive Education Events Center (SPEEC). As one attendee put it, “this might ruin it for the rest of your trip” because everything was so perfect.

It went up smoothly anyway and Nels encouraged me to join him on a roadside hike to the top of Multnomah Falls. I thought to myself, &ldquo;if you want exercise, let&rsquo;s have sex!&rdquo; but I knew it wasn&rsquo;t just physical activity I needed. I needed fresh air and nature. To the hike.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a017b5e05e3ea04d60e880cd60d450/tumblr_inline_pkwcizR7yU1s144lm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b></b>By the time I was ready to be done walking up the trail there was a sign declaring we had done 1 out of 11 switchbacks!? I looked at the sign in disgust and proceeded to go forward. Just like with the Sexplanations Road Tour my belief was that a past me knew what would be best for a future me and even though present me would struggle, it would be worth it. I thought of a lot of metaphors on the hike and topics for Sexplanations&rsquo; episodes. I pondered how jumping into the 620 foot falls would be the fastest way down but then I&rsquo;d be dead. </p><p>I did want Swedish meatballs, lingonberry juice, and retail therapy at Ikea before dinner at 5:30 and a speaking engagement at 7, so I ran down the mountain and got in the driver&rsquo;s seat. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1ac17295d1f2dfa9afd2197f00370b6/tumblr_inline_pkwce5I5DW1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We did Ikea in 45 minutes &ndash; got a cutting board, some floor mats, and cookware. Then it was off to Portland for real this time. Ethiopian food and my dear friend Ben from middle school were waiting for us. One of my greatest pleasures is eating with my hands.</p><p>After dinner, and just down the street was a meetup at the Sex Positive Education Events Center (SPEEC). As one attendee put it, &ldquo;this might ruin it for the rest of your trip&rdquo; because everything was so perfect. Angie, a sex therapist at SPEEC who&rsquo;d coordinated everything with a day&rsquo;s notice, had a projector for me to show Sexplanations, chocolates, comfy chairs, and a vibrator giveaway. The 20ish people who showed up were all spectacular!! We talked about sex positivity in the workplace, bisexual erasure, local resources, Nerdfighteria, the tour, and my experiences as a foster parent. I left with a gift of hand-made underwear and the overwhelming joy that Portland is in very good hands. </p><p>Afterward was second dinner with another dear friend and her partner. We went to the Chapel Pub where an organist was playing Sex Ed Rhapsody, &ldquo;sex ed really matters. Anyone can see. Sex ed really matters. It really really matters to me.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Friday January 4, 2019</p><p>Thursday we stayed up late drinking tea with Ben and talking about the future before camping in his driveway like hardcore vanlifers. With all that tea imbibed, the RV plumbing was activated that night. (Since we were coming from frozen Montana we had winterized the plumbing so nothing would break but now that we&rsquo;re in warmer temperatures and in need of a toilet regularly we have a semi-operational bathroom!)</p><p>Friday morning I ate RV breakfast &ndash; Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt with Bernice&rsquo;s Bakery granola from Missoula. It occured to me that I would run out of these items and there was a slight head tilt of mystery about five months of life without Missoula. We drove to visit Nels&rsquo; friend Jamie who had the day off from work and the two of them went on a hike in the forest while I took a much-needed shower and got some work done. I wasn&rsquo;t able to fit 80 hours of assignments into three hours but I was grateful that I got to check some things off the list and have time alone. </p><p>When Nels and Jamie came back to the house we went out for Panang Curry. Ben met us and we talked about Blue Planet playing on the restaurant TV. I didn&rsquo;t know that octopuses/octopodes could be magenta! </p><p>After food we all went separate directions. Jamie and Nels went to meet up with another friend and put a puzzle together. I took Ben to his house and then did a run to Fred Meyers for a mattress pad and some drawers to organize my art supplies. Lindsey driving around the city in an RV by herself is a badass!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/23d5a4e4e111971b86930c98d1720c6f/tumblr_inline_pkwc3xHQnR1s144lm_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The evening of Friday January 4, 2019</p><p>Nels and I drove to Gresham, Oregon about 40 minutes from where we were in Portland. The Sex Geek community was gathering for a short-notice potluck so I could spend time with kindred spirits. The house was beautiful and warm. Each person was so cool and the food was wonderful! It was like reconnecting with best friends even though these were people I knew loosely. We took a tour of the house, sat down picnic table style for dinner, then talked for hours. I learned that a handful of the sex geeks there had already been on tour, one of whom had taken on our very mission of providing sex ed around the country via RV. I learned about the Fisting Coven (of women who learn and practice fisting with supervision) and I discussed the infrequency of sexologists with children while smiling at a new baby nearby. I&rsquo;m curious. Some of the guests did a nude photo shoot featuring an gorgeous apple flower dessert and others compared notes on how they were raised. Everyone had a pretty unique upbringing except two of us who had grown up the same age in the same 6,000 person town in northeast Ohio, competing backstroke on swim teams, and walking past the Hudson green clocktower for milkshakes. Two 37 year old women who became well-known sex educators.</p><p>I eventually brought up my fear of speaking at Oxford&rsquo;s TEDx in February with one of the sex geeks who is a successful and talented public speaker. &nbsp;He listened lovingly to my nerves and and boosted my confidence then retrieved a stack of colored notecards for me to write down and practice my speech over the next month. I knew what I was experiencing was a birth. Between my friends, the SPEEC meetup, and nurturing dinner party of colleagues I was being born into trust that this would all be transformative and meaningful. </p><p>Saturday January 5, 2019</p><p>Same morning routine, Nels made coffee and started the ignition. We had a brunch date with friends of his from college at their house. &ldquo;At their house&rdquo; is a great preposition when you&rsquo;re road-tripping I&rsquo;ve already learned because there&rsquo;s a grounding feeling of front door, living room, bathroom, family dog etc. that you can&rsquo;t get eating out at restaurants. AND the food is outstanding, made with love. This food was incredible, the black lab was so affectionate, and their toddler provided the ever so welcome shared activity of observing a tiny human being instead of outputting a lot of energy in small talk. I like Nels friends a lot! </p><p>After we left their place I felt an urgent need to take a nap and have sex, in that order. Nels and I are usually sex-multiple-times-a-day people but we haven&rsquo;t prioritized it on the road. We got Costco gas, parked in the nearby lot, slept, then had much needed orgasms. I woke up hours later to Nels driving toward Eugene, Oregon where more of his friends had chicken masala for us &ldquo;at their house.&rdquo; I stayed in a relaxed state and committed to working later while they all socialized. As I write now they&rsquo;re playing one of my favorite card games &ndash; Bonanza, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be on a nearby couch, wrapped in a blanket, recalling day four. What a wondrous adventure I&rsquo;m on. </p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"video","blog_name":"tumblingdoe","blog":{"name":"tumblingdoe","title":"tum bling doe","description":"Are you looking for more sexplanations and more Dr. Doe?

I woke up again at 8:00 giddy to continue working on my to-do list. I put packages in the mail to Sexpla(i)nauts, dropped flowers off for friends, cuddled with my dog, and ate peanut butter bumpers and milk &ndash; a breakfast favorite. Then it was time to go. My partner Nels took the first shift of driving and as the 23 foot RV rattled down the road I found myself nesting. I put away art supplies, computer cords, toiletries, and dried food goods. I hung up clothes and made the bed. It was fun&rsquo;ish but the rumbling got to me and within 10 miles I was ready to go home. </p><p>I put in earplugs rather than giving up and ate some pineapple slices but the exclamations persisted &ldquo;get me out of this f****** vehicle!&rdquo; &ldquo;What was I thinking!?&rdquo; I was over it so Nels pulled over at a rest stop and we played in the snow, running laps and breathing in the pine air. I wore myself out and decided to try again. I hopped in the driver&rsquo;s seat hoping that being behind the wheel would make the road noise and vibrations more manageable. Sure enough I began chattering away &ldquo;this trip is going to be amazing!&rdquo; &ldquo;I love this little box on wheels.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so lucky to be doing this!&rdquo; That is, until I realized we&rsquo;d only gotten 100 miles down the road. </p><p>The next stop was a taco truck in Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho. While we waited to get the food I went across the street to a coffee shop, bought a bag of beans, and asked the baristas if they had any questions about sexuality for me to answer. The one who asked wasn&rsquo;t sure which words to say but I interpreted correctly that he wanted to know whether or not I thought gender and sexual orientation were born traits. Before I could answer, he said, &ldquo;if sex is for procreation then why would two men be attracted to each other?&rdquo; </p><p>I have talked with thousands of people about sexuality. I can read pretty quickly what kind of education a person has had and how their personal experiences have played into it. I can also tell to a degree whether a person is curious or trying to instigate me in a battle. This barista was curious and I was thrilled. I told him about the sexuality hypotheses in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG2BDMrcZcA&amp;t\">this video</a>. Unconcerned with the other patrons in the room, he said &ldquo;so if you and were siblings&rdquo; and I responded, &ldquo;and we had a brother, he&rsquo;d be more likely to be homosexual. And it would actually serve reproduction because he wouldn&rsquo;t have offspring to compete with our children for resources and he could be part of the support network that helps to successfully raise the next generation of our family.&rdquo; The other barista came back to the conversation at this point, pleased to have learned something and I was asked one more question. &ldquo;Do you believe in creation or evolution?&rdquo; We talked about my answer briefly &ndash; enchiladas were waiting for me.
